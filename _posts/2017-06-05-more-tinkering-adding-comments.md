I've finished the tutorial. Now for a small list of a few little refinements I *could* make in the future that are curently deliberate features in the site. 

Bottom menu:
Turn the 'Blog' item back into a link (unlike the top where it is a drop-down-menu). Alternativly, I could try my hand at a drop-up menu.

Responsive design:
Change 'Blog' on both bottom and top into a link back to my '/blog' index page.

Comments:
As I've blogged about previously, adding comments would help complete everything.

Social Media Links:
Reposition github to to the bottom and make it a little bigger, the porportion is off.

Blog Posts:
At some point my blog title list broke and is now hanging out on the left side of the page, even though it's aligned for the right side.
