While in Australia, I quickly realized my first experience with Vegemite  (around the year 2000) was an unfortunate combination of doing everything you should not do all at once. Here’s a guide to make sure you don’t have an unsavory experience with this tasty spread.

  1. **Use it sparingly:** Especially if you’re a first timer, a little goes a long way. A piece of toast might have a little evidence of this dark matter you can see in a couple of places on your whole piece of toast. Do not apply it like peanut butter in an even layer a quarter inch thick all over your piece of toast. Less is more.
  2. **Eat it with fat:** It was a huge revelation that a Vegemite sandwich actually has a piece of cheese in it. If you’re having a piece of toast, butter it first. Don’t like butter? Place some avocado on top of your toast after you apply your Vegemite.
  3. **Ensure the Vegemite is not ancient**: Unfortunately, my first experience with Vegemite was in the US around the age of ten, packed back from Australia by my grandparents who don’t like it. They&#8217;re also of the generation that never throws anything away. Their previous trip to Australia was before I was born, as was the expiration date on the bottom of the jar (1988). I know because I checked my grandmother&#8217;s pantry during a visit in 2015. Vegemite around 12 years past it&#8217;s expiration date is not tasty.

If you follow these three steps and still don&#8217;t like Vegemite, well you probably just don&#8217;t like Vegemite.

But if you do like Vegemite, now that you&#8217;ve got the basic steps, give these three different ways to eat it try.

  1. **Vegemite**** on buttered toast **is as simple as it gets. Lightly toast your bread and butter while it is still warm, apply a small amount of Vegemite, and enjoy.
  2. **Vegemite**** and avocado **can be prepared as instructed above. Then place avocado slices on top and enjoy.
  3. **Vegemite sandwich** is a lunchtime variation notably different from its breakfast counterpart characterized by two slices of bread, buttered (optional) and Vegemite applied. Place a slice of cheddar cheese in the middle. It&#8217;s my understanding other variations are out there including the additions of lettuce, tomato, and/or avocado. Most recently learned of a Vegemite sandwich with hot chips (thick cut french fries) or crunchy chips (potato chips), which I haven&#8217;t tried as of yet.
