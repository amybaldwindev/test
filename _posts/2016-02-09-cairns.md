With so much to do around **Cairns**, you&#8217;ll want to ensure you don&#8217;t miss the things to do IN Cairns. Be sure to make time to stop at the **night markets **(pamper yourself and get a massage while you&#8217;re there) and if you have the time a few hours walking<span style="color:#0000ff;"> </span>around a Cairns during the day is quite enjoyable.

The **sunset colors of Cairns** are quite **photogenic**.

**I love fruit and you simply cannot buy finer quality mango&#8217;s, guava, bananas, etc. outside of the tropics** (not to mention buying food at the markets **money saving trick**)! Luckily, <a href="http://www.rustysmarkets.com.au/" target="_blank">Rusty&#8217;s Markets</a> is right in the middle of Cairns and really easy to get to! The vendors were really helpful when I explained I didn&#8217;t know how to pick out the fruit. Below is one mornings breakfast. A nice guy at the hostel even showed me how to cut the mango like this. You must absolutely take advantage of this opportunity while you&#8217;re in Cairns.

It&#8217;s not every day you get to go to a **botanical garden in the tropics**. Be sure to stop in at the <a href="http://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/cbg" target="_blank">Cairns Botanical Gardens</a> to visit some lovely gardens. We took a walk on the boardwalks through tropical rainforest plants.

There were an abundance of **butterflies and dragonflies** who call the gardens home.

Of course, **Cairns is a great base for many excursions** and you&#8217;ll probably want to consult a travel desk while you are there. To name a few of so many opportunities around Cairns you can book a tour or self-drive the [**Atherton Tablelands Waterfall circuit**](https://wp.me/p7eEKI-Aj). Next time, I plan to spend some time in **Youngburra** and go canoeing during early morning in hopes of seeing platypus while I&#8217;m there. Rent a car and go North towards[ **Cape Tribulation**](https://wp.me/p7eEKI-zD). Take a day excursion to [**Kuranda**](https://wp.me/s7eEKI-kuranda) to experience a microcosm of Queensland must-do tourist activities. You can book **helicopter flights** **over the Great Barrier Reef** and/or get **PADI certified** (or just go **scuba diving** at the GBR). Cairns is a great place to** start or end your travels along the Australia&#8217;s East Coast**, as well as a great place to base your holiday.
