A great day trip from **Cairns** is a visit the beautiful **Atherton Tablelands** to check out the popular **Waterfall Circuit** by self-drive or tour and enjoy the picturesque countryside.

<p align="left">
  We stopped at the <strong>Cathedral and Curtain Fig Trees, </strong>which aren&#8217;t long stops but amazing to see!
</p>

The original tree eventually rotted away leaving the open space where I am standing . I have no idea if the gap I walked into this space occurred naturally as I am standing on a boardwalk.

  We took a forest walk at <strong>Lake Barrine National Park </strong>where we saw forest dragons, and learned about the local plants (some of which you do not want to touch so watch out).
</p>

  We went for a swim at many waterfalls including Australia&#8217;s most photographed Millaa Millaa falls.

  Herbal Essence commercials were recreated. I was surprised by how difficult it was to get the water dispersion for the shot but my tour guide was very helpful advising on proper technique. Also, I did this tour at the very end of the dry season, I recommend trying to time this to be somewhere in early middle of dry season so you get nice weather and more water flow.

   We then adventured into <strong>Mount Hypipamee National Park</strong> to swim at<strong> Dinner Falls</strong>. There is cassowary&#8217;s around which are known for being aggressive (and occasionally deadly) so I was glad not to see them. Admittedly, a very small part of me was really sad the only time I saw a cassowary was in an animal park in Victoria.

After that we took off to try and spot a platypus. We found one, but I didn&#8217;t get a good picture of it. Some friends I met traveling stayed overnight in **Yungaburra** and went canoeing the next morning while the platypus were feeding. Their experiences sounded far superior to mine.

Overall it was a great day out, and you should go next time you find yourself in or around **Cairns.**
