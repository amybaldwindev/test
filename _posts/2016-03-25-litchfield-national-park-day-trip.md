If you have the time, you must go on this beautiful day trip from **Darwin** to **Litchfield National Park. **While there, we went swimming, had a barbecue, took a few short hikes, and enjoyed the beautiful waterfalls which do not disappoint.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4224" src="http://exploringducky.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/darwin-takeatripamy-122.jpg" alt="Litchfield National Park, Northern Territory, Australia" width="700" height="933" />

There are amazing rock pools to go swimming in such as this one.

Then we went to check out the cathedral termite, the one below was probably 4 meters high.<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4232" src="https://exploringducky.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/darwin-122.jpg?w=682&#038;h=1024" alt="Cathedral Termite Mound, Litchfield National Park, Northern Territory, Australia" width="682" height="1024" />

After spending a lovely morning and afternoon in **Litchfield**, we headed down to the **Adelaide River** to go on a **Jumping Crocodile Tour**.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4231" src="http://exploringducky.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/darwin-takeatripamy-152.jpg" alt="Jumping Croc Tour, Adelaide River, Northern Territory, Australia" width="559" height="699" />

Our tour operator had a great sense of humor which wasn&#8217;t in short supply during our tour..<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4226" src="http://exploringducky.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/darwin-takeatripamy-162.jpg" alt="Jumping Crocodile Tour, Northern Territory, Australia" width="700" height="525" />

After that, we headed back to **Darwin**. It was a great day trip, and I&#8217;d recommend you spend at least a day here (longer if you can) exploring this beautiful place.
