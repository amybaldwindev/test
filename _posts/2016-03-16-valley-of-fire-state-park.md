A change of pace and fabulous day trip from the** Las Vegas Strip** is the **Valley of Fire State Park**. The park offers stunning sandstone formations created by shifting sands during the time of the dinosaurs and shaped by erosion. We decided to do a couple of hikes including the **White Domes **and the **Fire Wave.** Both were stunning in their own right. I would have done more but when sunset came, it was time to leave. It would be legit to camp here overnight and spend more time. If you&#8217;d like to plan your trip you should look at the <a href="https://www.takeatripamy.com/valley-of-fire-state-park/valley-of-fire-state-park-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-4133">Valley of Fire State Park Information Brochure (December, 2015)</a> which I received at the park gate.
