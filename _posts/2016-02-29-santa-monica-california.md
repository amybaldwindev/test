I&#8217;m currently based in Los Angeles, so I&#8217;ve been working on seeing all the places I can get to in a day or visit for the weekend. Santa Monica located roughly 12 miles from Downtown. It&#8217;s currently difficult get to, but all that should change soon as the EXPO Line of the Metro (train) opens early 2016.

**Why you&#8217;ll want to go: **check out the shopping along the 3rd St. Promenade, the fantastic local shops and restaurants, take a walk or bike ride down the multi-purpose track which runs along the beach. You&#8217;ll want to take the opportunity capture this scenic pier as you see it with your own lens.

The **Santa Monica Pier** which is packed with people and a little theme park. There&#8217;s also a couple of restaurants and some flea market type vendors selling cheap food or some campy Route 66 merchandise as Santa Monica marks the end/start of the historic route.

The pier is of course surrounded by gorgeous beach you can access. I&#8217;ll be thoroughly inspecting the beach for swimming conditions come summer.

There is lovely multipurpose track you can rent a bike on and ride along with scenic views. Then be sure to get back in time to take photos at sunset.
