From time to time we make the trek from Southern California to Seattle. Last summer we drove it including a pit-stop; we were going to get out and hike the **Redwoods**. We didn&#8217;t have a lot of time so I consulted the internet to try and find a small hike that still showcased some highlights from this beautiful area. I found the **Lady Bird Johnson Grove Trail.** The trail is located approximately two miles (3.6 km) off highway 101 and is an easy one mile (1.6 km) walking loop through the ancient forest. It fits the bill for convenience, taking hardly any extra time to get there and minimal time to walk it. It is the perfect stop for the traveler passing through who doesn&#8217;t have time to explore this beautiful area properly!

The trail head has both a toilet and parking area.
