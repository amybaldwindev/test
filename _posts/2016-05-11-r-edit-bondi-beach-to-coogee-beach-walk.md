An absolute must while visiting Sydney you must do the Bondi to Coogee walk. About 6 km in length, we started at Bondi Beach in the North, and walked South concluding at Coogee Beach. This coastal clifftop walk is great opportunity to experience a number of Sydney&#8217;s gorgeous beaches in about an hour and a half.

**Special considerations while planning**

For a Sunday visit there is a market off of Campbell Parade at Bondi Beach. Learn more about the Bondi Market at their webpage [here](http://www.bondimarkets.com.au/).

If your visit is from mid October through early November you may be able to catch the [Sculptures by the Sea &#8211; Bondi](http://sculpturebythesea.com/) event, which as you might be able to guess from the name, brings the addition of Sculptures created by artist to already scenic seaside. I have never attended this event at the Bondi Beach location, but did attend the event at Cottesloe Beach in Western Australia. The Cottesoloe Beach location was an amazing collection of works of art on the backdrop of stunning landscape. Check out their website for information relating to their next events.

The walk has lots of shops, cafes, rock pools (ocean side swimming pools). You can easily decide to do the walk in one go, or stop along the way for a swim, surf, paddle board etc.

Be sure to take a camera with you on this walk as it really shows off the beauty of the coastal city of Sydney.<figure id="attachment_4441" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
