We spent most of a day in the** Bay of Fires, **having a picnic, swimming, surfing, and climbing the big colorful rocks.

Despite being cold, I could not resist the urge to at least play in the water a little bit.

Wineglass Bay is a beautiful hike in **Freycinet National Park**. Go to the carpark for a short and steep walk up to the lookout which hosts amazing views of the bay. Be sure to go down to the water&#8217;s edge if you&#8217;re physically able as it is stunning there as well.

The **Bicheno Blowhole** is a fun stop and the photo opportunities are limitless! We had great fun trying to get as close to it as we could without getting wet! On the advice of a local we went down at dusk to see if we could see the little penguins coming into shore instead of booking a cruise to see them. We had no luck with finding the penguins, but it was a beautiful evening. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4287" src="http://exploringducky.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/bichino-4-edit2.jpg" alt="Bicheno Blowhole, Tasmania, Australia" width="623" height="467" />

Before we made it to the blowhole, I had to capture the sunset at Bicheno.
