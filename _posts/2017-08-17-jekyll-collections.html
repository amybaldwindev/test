		One of the common functionalities of the modern blog is the ability to tag/categorize everything by it's subject, and I love this feature which I've played with in WordPress.
	</p>
	<p>
		My coding blog, however, is generated on Jekyll, a static site generator designed for a no-frills blog I host on GitHub.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've been reading about various options. Some considerations include I would like to avoid plugins if possible, so I'm looking for a native way to add this. I also don't want to invest a lot of human effort into this once it's set-up.

		Makes defult <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/" target="_blank">permalink</a> long. Permalink can be customized, however site will need to be reworked to accomidate that.
