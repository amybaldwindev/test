I got my first camera for my trip to Australia. People were hyper critical of the fact I chose to take a mid-range point-and-shoot camera with me instead of a big DSLR. As I told those who criticized the decision, I had no photography experience and didn’t think I’d find a big DSLR worthwhile (and it took up too much space in my backpack). The photos you see of Australia are taken with that. It was a great tool to learn on, and I eventually bought a flexible tripod to help keep the camera still for longer exposures (waterfalls) and low light experiences. I have now upgraded to a DSLR, but I haven’t decided if it’s a better choice for the casual traveler.

If you&#8217;re planning an otherwise low budget trip and are not a photography guru, there are a ton of reasons to opt for a point-and-shoot camera and leave that big DSLR on the shelf at the store.

**It should be noted I am discussing mid to high range point-and-shoot cameras**. At first, I was going to include some specs and price ranges to look for. After consideration of the fact the features and costs will change all the time, I&#8217;ve decided to let you do your own research.  I&#8217;ve complied some reasons I&#8217;m glad chose this option with the photography skills I arrived in Australia with.

**It fits in your pocket:** Before I fell in love with photography, there is no way I’d go through the effort of taking a big camera with me. You can buy a point-and-shoot that fits in your pocket. That&#8217;s the major reason I had a good quality camera around when those unforgettable moments happened.

**It attracts less attention**: These cameras being smaller don&#8217;t call as much attention to themselves making it less likely anyone will target your camera for theft because they don&#8217;t perceive it to be as valuable or expensive.

**It is easy to use:** Until I stated cultivating my skills to use the camera&#8217;s features to capture the images as I saw them, I needed something I could sort of aim and hope for the best with. The point and shoot not only did this well, but didn&#8217;t seem intimidating.

**There are plenty of features to explore, play, and grow with: **after initially pointing and hoping for the best, I began to play with features like adjusting the exposure and shutter speed. A little later I was playing with the aperture. There were plenty of settings to grow into.

**I could transform my favorite photos into 8 X 10&#8217;s. **This may rely on you buying a camera that costs more than $100. My camera had good enough lenses and resolution (and some other stuff) where my favorite photos can make great gifts and looks fantastic on my wall.

**Memory Chips**: The size of the picture is smaller so you won&#8217;t have as much latitude to crop your images and still have a large print, but you won&#8217;t fill up your memory chips as fast either.

**Considering all this, you might conclude your cell phone has all of these benefits as well buy I don&#8217;t recommend you rely only on your phone because:**

**A camera will provide you with higher quality photos: **Cell phone cameras are amazing for what they are, but they&#8217;re not as high quality and they&#8217;re not able to adapt to as many situations as a regular camera.

**You don&#8217;t drain your battery: ** Even with limited skills, my battery on my phone wouldn&#8217;t have survived each day.
