<h2>The Assignment</h2>
<li>Create a to-do-list using simple JavaScript without any framework</li>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Plunker</li>

<h2>What makes it different</h2>
<li>Weekly office hours available.</li>
<li>Single project start to finish that starts simple and gets more complicated</li>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>This is a great tutorial which starts out very basic and really leaves nothing out. As of 8/10, I'm about 80% done and working on v9.</p>
