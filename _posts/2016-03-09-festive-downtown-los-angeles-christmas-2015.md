Christmas can be a great time to create and take a self-guided walking tour around a city. With the help of a friend who is a Los Angeles native, and by consulting a walk for tourist we found online we planned a pretty cool day out. It was great fun, though I learned in Los Angeles Happy Hour is only a Monday through Friday affair, so drinks and snacks were a little more expensive than we had hoped. Here is some of the cool stuff around Downtown Los Angeles during the festive season.**
  
** 

The Gingerbread Village at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites, Los Angeles is an annual (free) event in the lobby. By sounds of it this started as a little project working with a culinary school and the tradition gets bigger each year. I think it&#8217;s super-duper cute! The amount of detail going into the displays shows off each student&#8217;s skill, creativity and talent. Plus, the hotel building itself has a futuristic sort of architecture about it that I thought was really cool.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4027" src="http://exploringducky.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/dtlosangeles-christmas-takeatripamy-1-12.jpg" alt="Gingerbread Christmas Village, Bonaventure Hotel, Los Angeles, California, United States" width="700" height="466" />
  
**The Last Bookstore **is this quirky and fun local establishment brimming with character! It doesn&#8217;t need to be Christmas time to visit this fine establishment. Located in central downtown Los Angeles it was fabulous to pop-in and check it out. You will have to check your bags at the door, but once you&#8217;re in you are re free to roam, and photograph. I had my big camera with me that day and was a little nervous about leaving all my lenses in the bag checked at the front of the store, but there was no trouble (the store doesn&#8217;t take responsibility if there is trouble). There are cool art installations featuring books, cool places to take pictures, and of course you can actually buy books there too. It was a really fun time.

I enjoyed the opportunity to practice some nighttime photography without trying to work around a lot of people.

Designed by Frank Gehry, the outside of this architecture definitely makes a statement. I&#8217;ve heard the concert hall inside is stunning, but haven&#8217;t checked it out for myself as the events I&#8217;m most interested in have been fully booked months in advance

Grand Park is a pretty cool place. It is directly across from the iconic county courthouse and central to the arts district. There are often cultural events happening here during the day, and I found it very pretty at night, particularly with festive palm trees to celebrate the season.

This photo was taken from a structure connecting foot bridges across the streets on one side of the Bonaventure Hotel. The Los Angeles Central Library is framed in the center, and I think it&#8217;s interesting surrounded by skyscrapers.

Olvera Street is free with market stalls, street vendors, and a few (free) museums of historical significance to Los Angeles. It&#8217;s right next to Union Station, the city&#8217;s hub for all public transportation. It&#8217;s a wonderful place to walk through and experience the culture. One lady I passed was telling no one in particular she was buying gift souvenirs for her grandchildren. This place is perfect for such activities.

**Notes:** These neighborhoods are pretty safe during the day, but there are a lot of homeless people. The Los Angeles homeless population I&#8217;ve interacted with are the most aggressive beggars I&#8217;ve encountered, ever. If you want to keep a dollar or two in your pockets you can, but I personally wouldn&#8217;t get my wallet out of my bag. It&#8217;s an area where it&#8217;s still probably best to walk around with someone, so if you&#8217;re traveling solo, you may want to consider a group walking tour for that reason.

Save some cash and visit Downtown Los Angeles M &#8211; F early in time for Happy Hour. We added a few fine eating establishments and bars to our walking tour.

Visiting from out-of-town and like to party? There is a budding nightlife in the heart of Los Angeles. From speakeasies to clubs where flapper dresses, burlesque, and bow ties are a thing, you can have a great night on the town (though you&#8217;ll pay at least $14 for a fancy cocktail and most beers are at least $6). Of course the reputation in the area also has some pretty raunchy places so you&#8217;ll want to know where you plan to go before going out. Be safe and use a ride share service or the Metro on your way home and try and minimize walking by yourself.
