Did you know that you can climb the **Sydney Harbour Bridge**? I didn&#8217;t until I learned about this opportunity from fellow travelers who were wondering if the expensive fees associated with doing so made it worth it? The general consensus was that yes, it is worth it!

If you&#8217;re interested in this there is only one company that provides this service: BridgeClimb Sydney. It was fun to see their organization and procedure before, during, and after the climb.
  
The options:

Day Climb: See Sydney Harbour from the highest point of the bridge during the day.

Night Climb: See Sydney Harbour from the highest point of the bridge during at night.

Twilight Climb: See Sydney Harbour during dusk (you get to see the sights transition from day to night).

We opted to attend a **twilight climb**, and were outfitted with a grey jumpsuit so we would blend in with the bridge. Then everything we could possibly want during the climb was attached to us (jumpers, rain jacket, etc). Our guide gave us a nice history of the bridge including information like it&#8217;s controversy, how it was built &#8220;for the future&#8221;, how the bridges construction helped many people in the community survive financially during the Great Depression, and a cute story about his grandmother during the opening ceremonies for the bridge.

My only disappointment was the guide had the only camera allowed up on the bridge, so you&#8217;re photo options will be at the mercy of your tour guide&#8217;s photography skills. And of course you&#8217;ll want pictures so plan to pay at least $60 in fees for your photo at the end. Still, even with that, it&#8217;s pretty cool.
