A few years back a new train safety campaign went viral. There were little characters who would die doing stupid things all set to the wonderful catchy tune. I remember the internet craze and eventually forgot. Until I arrived in Melbourne and saw the campaign painted on the wall at Finders Street Station and at various train stations. They play it weekdayÂ morning on the station on repeat, so if you pass through during<span style="color:#0000ff;">Â </span>commuting hours you&#8217;re sure to hear it. If you&#8217;re not familiar with this catchy jingle (and silly, but important video) you have the pleasure of enlightening yourself below. Happy watching! ðŸ™‚
