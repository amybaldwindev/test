**See the Whitsunday Islands.** Book or charter a vessel and go forward and explore. There&#8217;s fabulous snorkeling to be had, great hiking, and if you have a larger budget, there are luxury islands, resorts, and flight tours that will happily take your money.

The **Airlie Beach Boardwalk** is a 3.7 km scenic walk from Cannonvale Beach to the Marina. Our accommodation was about 2k from the city center and very close to this boardwalk so we walked it may times. Each trip was rewarded with beautiful ocean views, wildlife, and ambiance. It&#8217;s even lit so it&#8217;s great to walk after sunset.

**Dine at fine ****restaurants**. We decided to eat at a cute cafe near the boardwalks end at cannonvale beach and also selected a lovely restaurant we passed on the boardwalk to Airlie Beach side and in every case the food and coffee was fabulous!

Explore the **city center** of Airlie Beach. There are some lovely shops, cafes, and an Esplanade. I even found awesome Aussie themed Christmas decor on the footpaths.
