**Magnetic Island** (aka **Maggi**e) is a beautiful island you can catch a **ferry** from **Townsville**. Once on the island, you can take **public transportation** to your accommodation. We used the public transportation to get all around, though there are **Mokes** (really tiny cars that resemble miniature Jeeps) available for hire.

Roughly half the island is <a href="http://www.nprsr.qld.gov.au/parks/magnetic-island/about.html" target="_blank">Magnetic Island National Park</a>, and there are lots of trails and tracks you can take. This is one of those places with lots of koala&#8217;s in the trees so you can take the various tracks and look up, and you might see one if you&#8217;re observant and lucky. For more information about visiting the national park and its many tracks, swimming, and safety advice click <a href="http://www.nprsr.qld.gov.au/parks/magnetic-island/about.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

We went to go check out and meet the animals at the **animal park on the island** (affiliated with the island&#8217;s YHA). It was a blast, and I got to get my **&#8220;take pictures with these animals&#8221; bucket lis**t covered in one afternoon! I got to **hold a baby crocodile** and **cuddle a koala!** If cuddling a koala is on your bucket list it should be noted that it is not legal in New South Wales and Victoria. I was very excited to meet and cuddle Pebbles (pictured below).

I was also pleased to meet this handsome fellow.

The island has lots of **beautiful beaches** to enjoy.

**Know before you go: **

There is a small supermarket on the island. I cried when I saw the quality of fruit and veggies available. After looking around a bit for something fresh, I decided to buy a few cans of flavored tuna and some cruskits. We ended up eating out the few days we were there. **I recommend buying any fresh fruit or veggies you&#8217;ll want on the island from the mainland.**

Many hiking trails have nowhere to get fresh water. You&#8217;ll want to have the capacity to take enough water with you.

All and all we had a great time on Maggie Island and stayed longer than we had originally planned.
