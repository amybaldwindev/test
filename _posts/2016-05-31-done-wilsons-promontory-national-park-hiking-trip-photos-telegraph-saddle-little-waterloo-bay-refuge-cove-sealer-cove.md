  One of my favorite places of all time in Australia is Wilsons Promontory National Park. The park is located at the southern most point in Victoria and takes a bit of effort to get to, but is worth the extra effort as it is superb. Beautiful beaches, wildlife, camping, and hiking there is so much for any outdoor enthusiast. I went with an awesome group of people for a 35 km hike over a weekend.

  If you have the time to do a hike such as this one I recommend it. For a less adventurous time in this area I hear visiting and staying at the cottages near the lighthouse is quite nice and provides a few more creature comforts including beds, and hot plates. I don&#8217;t know much more about it because I opted for a high adventure camping and hiking excursion.

  <strong>The Itinerary </strong>

  <strong>About the Hike</strong>
</div>

<div>
  I found the hike to be challenging, and its various segments range from easy to moderate/hard. I couldn&#8217;t find any official measurements regarding elevation changes, but the track gently undulates with climbs and descents<span style="color:#3366ff;">. </span>In addition, you&#8217;ll experience portions with cliff sidewalks, rainforest boardwalk, and a segment at Sealers cove you&#8217;ll be crossing through the water, so you&#8217;ll want to be sure to check the tides to avoid crossing at high tide. You may also want to pack an extra towel to dry off your feet thoroughly with because it still may be deep enough you&#8217;ll want to remove your boots. Otherwise the worst muddy bits have boardwalks over them so you won&#8217;t experience any difficulty or misery getting through them. An old-timer in the club I went with liked telling stories of the so called &#8216;glory days&#8217; of his youth when there was no boardwalk.<span style="color:#3366ff;"> </span>Many portions of the track will reward you with gorgeous views and there&#8217;s lots of wildlife around. The photos below are some of my favorite and allow you to see why I very much hope to be going back again someday.

    <strong>Now, I&#8217;ll stop blathering because there is nothing I can say that does justice to this wonderful place in Australia. So, look at the photos and see for yourself.</strong>
